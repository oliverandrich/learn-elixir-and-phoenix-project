# Read It Later

This is the source code of my little Elixir and Phoenix learning project, I use in my blog post series on [dev.to](https://dev.to/), where I learn this technologies in public.

Every tag of this projects corresponds to what I have wrote about in the individual blog posts.

During this project I plan to develop a simple read-it-later service, which might later on evolve into a full fledged solution I enjoy to use. But this is the scope of a different project.
