# Read It Later

This is the source code of my little Elixir and Phoenix learning project, I use in my blog post series on [dev.to](https://dev.to/), where I learn this technologies in public.

Every tag of this projects corresponds to what I have wrote about in the individual blog posts.

During this project I plan to develop a simple read-it-later service, which might later on evolve into a full fledged solution I enjoy to use. But this is the scope of a different project.

## Getting started

I assume that you have installed the required components (Elixir, Phoenix, Node and PostgreSQL) as described in my first [post](https://dev.to/oliverandrich/learn-elixir-and-phoenix-by-building-a-read-it-later-service-project-setup-3d1c).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oliverandrich/learn-elixir-and-phoenix-project.git read_it_later
cd read_it_later
mix deps.get
cd assets
npm install
cd ..
mix phx.server
```
